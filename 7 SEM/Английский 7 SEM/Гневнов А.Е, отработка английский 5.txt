I agree with this result(19). I am competitive in important areas. I believe that winning is everything in those situations. However, I do not compete in my daily or personal life. I prefer to earn enough for a comfortable life. I am genuinely pleased when colleagues succeed. This shows I avoid unnecessary competition and pressure. I only focus my competitive drive where it truly matters to me.

1.It's not a level playing field, any more. As a small company it is difficult for us to compete with the big multinationals. This means the small company does not have the same resources or advantages as its larger rivals.

2.They are so far ahead of their competitors in terms of new products that it has become a one-horse race. It will be years before they face any serious competition. They are effectively the only serious contender in the market.

3.We spend a lot of money on R & D so we can stay ahead of the game. This strategy ensures the company remains more advanced or successful than its rivals.

4.The government have changed all the rules for exporters. They have moved the goalposts, so we will have to rethink our international operation. The rules were changed during the competition, making the original strategy impossible.

5.It's a waste of time continuing with the project. It will never work. We are flogging a dead horse. The project has no chance of success, and continuing is just wasting effort.

6.With our market dominance in the US, we are really in the driving seat. We have control and power over the market decisions.

7.We have exactly the same market share as our nearest rival. We are neck and neck in terms of our profits so far this year, too. Both companies are at exactly the same level in the competition.

8.We really need to concentrate on what our competitors are doing. In today's market you need to keep your eye on the ball at all times. This means you must stay focused and pay attention to what is important.

D.

Have you ever felt you were flogging a dead horse? Yes, I often feel like I am flogging a dead horse when I try to learn a complex new programming language. I spend hours reading documentation and watching tutorials, but the error messages keep popping up.

Which companies are ahead of the game? In technology, NVIDIA and Tesla are clearly ahead. They constantly focus on new ideas (innovation), so competitors are always trying to catch up.

How do you feel when a) someone moves the goalposts? b) you are in the driving seat? a) I feel frustrated because my first plan is wasted. I must quickly make a new strategy. b) I feel confident and in control. I can decide the direction and make all the important decisions.

II. Video The 4 Ps of the marketing mix:

summarize the theory given in the video:

The Marketing Mix is a framework that helps companies plan their product strategy. It is made up of four key elements, known as the 4 Ps:

Product: This is what you sell, including its quality, design, packaging, and brand.

Price: This is how much you charge, including the retail price, discounts, and payment terms.

Promotion: This is how you tell customers about the product, using advertising, sales, and public relations.

Place: This is where and how you sell the product, including stores, delivery, or downloads (distribution). 

choose the product and identify its 4 Ps, give your reasons (7-10 sentences):

The 4 Ps for Apple AirPods Pro
The Product is a set of premium wireless earbuds. They have a special design and include noise cancellation. The Apple brand is very strong. The Price is high because they are a premium item. Apple uses the high price to show high quality. The Promotion uses simple ads that highlight the noise cancellation feature. They focus on how easy they are to use. The Place (distribution) is mostly through official Apple Stores. This strategy keeps the product image exclusive. All four Ps work together to target customers who want luxury and high quality.

II. Video Porter's Generic Strategies:

summarize the theory given in the video:

Michael Porter identified three main strategies for a company to gain a competitive advantage and stay profitable. These are called the Generic Strategies:

Cost Leadership: The goal is to offer the lowest price in the industry. This is achieved by constantly reducing operating costs, supply chain expenses, and production costs.

Differentiation: The goal is to offer a unique product or service that customers value. This uniqueness can be based on superior quality, innovative features, excellent customer service, or a strong brand image.

Focus Strategy: The goal is to concentrate on a very specific, small market niche. Within this niche, the company will use either a low-cost approach or a differentiation approach to meet the unique needs of that specific customer group.

provide 3-5 examples (companies/brands) to each type of strategy (For example, low-cast str.: McDonald's, ..., ...):

Cost Leadership: Walmart, McDonald's, IKEA

Differentiation: Apple, Rolex, Tesla

Focus Strategy: Ferrari, Lego, Rolls-Royce
