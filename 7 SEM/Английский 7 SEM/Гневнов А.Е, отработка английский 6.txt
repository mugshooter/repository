I.Video What is business ethics
General ethics are the simple rules for your personal life. They tell you what is right and wrong every day. Business ethics are the specific rules for the workplace. These work rules are much more strict than your personal rules. The employer sets these business rules, and they are not flexible. They must follow all laws and company policy. You must follow these business rules when you are at work.
